BSB - Business-to-Business (B2B) Gateways integrate data from back-end
      systems enabling information exchange across trading partners.
      B2B Gateways also provide a centralized point for transformation
      of multiple data sources through interoperability standards such
      as XML (Extensible Markup Language), cXML(Commerce XML) and EDI
      (Electronic data interchange).  B2B Gateways provide businesses
      an e-commerce platform for integrating with key suppliers and
      customers quickly and easily.
